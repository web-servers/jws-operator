## Parameter to use in CRD

# replicas (mandatory all configuration)

That is the number of pods of the JWS image you want to run. Use at least 2!

```
  replicas: 2
```

# applicationName (mandatory all configuration)

That is the name of the application, it must be unique in the namespace/project. Note it is used to create the route to access
to that application.

```
  applicationName: test
```

# applicationImage (customized images)

That is the URL to find the image you want to use with the operator. For example:

```
applicationImage: docker.io/jfclere/tomcat-demo
```

# JbossWebImageStream

That describes the ImageStream to provide images to run or to build, the latest image in the stream is used.

## imageStreamName (mandatory BuildImage)

That is the ImageStream you created to allow the operator to find the base images:

```bash
oc create -f xpaas-streams/jws53-tomcat9-image-stream.json
imagestream.image.openshift.io/jboss-webserver53-tomcat9-openshift created
```

Here: imageStream: `jboss-webserver53-tomcat9-openshift:latest`

## imageStreamNamespace (BuildImage only)

That is the namespace/project in which you create the ImageStream

```bash
oc create -f xpaas-streams/jws53-tomcat9-image-stream.json -n jfc
imagestream.image.openshift.io/jboss-webserver53-tomcat9-openshift created
```

Here: imageStreamNamespace: jfc

# JbossWebSources

Describe where the sources are located and how build them

## sourceRepositoryUrl (Mandatory BuildImage)

That the URL were the sources are located, the source should have a maven pom.xml to allow a maven build, the produced war is put
in the webapps directory of image /opt/jws-5.x/tomcat/webapps. See `ARTIFACT_DIR" here too.

```
 sourceRepositoryUrl: 'https://github.com/jfclere/demo-webapp.git'
```

## sourceRepositoryRef (Mandatory BuildImage)

That is the branch you want to build.

```
sourceRepositoryRef: master
```

## contextDir (BuildImage only)

That is the sub directory where the pom.xml is located and where the `mvn install` should be run.

```
  contextDir: /
```

## JbossWebSourcesParams

Those are additional parameter of JbossWebSourcesParams to describe how to build the application images.

### ARTIFACT_DIR (BuidImage only)

The ARTIFACT_DIR is a parameter of SourceBuildStrategy the operator is using. It is the directory were maven put the war it creates for the webapp.
The contents of ARTIFACT_DIR is copied in the webapps directory of the image /opt/jws-5.x/tomcat/webapps the default value is target.

### MAVEN_MIRROR_URL (BuildImage only)

The MAVEN_MIRROR_URL is a parameter of SourceBuildStrategy the operator is using. It is the maven proxy URL maven will use to build the webapp. You need it if your cluster has not access to the Internet.

### genericWebhookSecret (BuildImage only)

That is a secret for a webhook to trigger a build.
Create a secret.yaml like:

```
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: qwerty
data:
  WebHookSecretKey: cXdlcnR5Cg==
```

For the value of WebHookSecretKey use a file and base64 to encode it:
Put in secret.txt

```
qwerty
```

And run base64

```bash
base64 secret.txt
cXdlcnR5Cg==
```

Here: genericWebhookSecret: qwerty

To test it:
1 - get the URL:

```bash
oc describe BuildConfig | grep webhooks
	URL:		https://api.jclere.rhmw-runtimes.net:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/jfc/buildconfigs/test/webhooks/<secret>/generic
```

2 - Create a minimal JSON file (payload.json)

```
{}
```

3 - Cut the URL replacing <secret> by its value and use the minimal JSON file:

```bash
curl -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://api.jclere.rhmw-runtimes.net:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/jfc/buildconfigs/test/webhooks/qwerty/generic

  "metadata": {

  },
  "status": "Success",
  "message": "no git information found in payload, ignoring and continuing with build",
  "code": 200
}
```

The build is triggered.

4 - Use it in github:

Go to Setting+Webhooks+Add webhook in your github project and add the URL in the Payload URL, set Content type: application/json, Disable SSL verification if needed and click Add webhook. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/builds/triggering-builds-build-hooks.html for more details.

### githubWebhookSecret (BuildImage only)

That is a web hook specific to GitHub, it works like `genericWebhookSecret`

```
githubWebhookSecret: qwerty
```

# JbossWebServerHealthCheck

That describes the health check to use the default is to use the health valve and doesn't require any parameters.

## serverReadinessScript

That is the script used to check if a pod is ready. That is only mandary for JWS-5.3 iamges.
An empty or not existing is the default. The default is to check http://localhost:8080/health using OpenShift internal.
For example the JWS-5.3 is:

```
  serverReadinessScript: >-
    /bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/curl --noproxy '*' -s -u
    ${JWS_ADMIN_USERNAME}:${JWS_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
    'http://localhost:8080/manager/jmxproxy/?get=Catalina%3Atype%3DServer&att=stateName'
    | /usr/bin/grep -iq 'stateName *= *STARTED'"
```

For the formats see the README.md.

## serverLivenessScript

That is the script to check that a pod is alive. That is NOT mandatory.

## JbossWebServer53HealthCheck

That is needed only if you use the manager webapp to check if Tomcat is started, that is mostly for JWS-5.3 and older images version.

### jwsAdminUsername (JWS-5.3 images only)

That is the admin user created in /opt/jws-5.3/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml for the JWS-5.3 health check only.

```
jwsAdminUsername: tomcat
```

### jwsAdminPassword (JWS-5.3 images only)

That is the password of the user created in /opt/jws-5.3/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml for the JWS-5.3 health check only.

```
  jwsAdminPassword: tomcat
```
