                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.

                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
